FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The New York Jets-Aaron Rodgers marriage appears to be ending after two disappointing seasons, as the future Hall of Fame quarterback is unlikely to remain with the team in 2025, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Sunday.
Rodgers, 41, flew to New Jersey last week to meet with new coach Aaron Glenn and new general manager Darren Mougey, a source confirmed to ESPN. Fox Sports reported Sunday that Rodgers was informed in that meeting that the team has decided to part ways with him.
A Jets spokesman declined to confirm the report.
Glenn has been in contact with Rodgers since he was hired, as part of an evolving discussion on the quarterback's future. Glenn, at his introductory news conference on Jan. 27, was noncommittal on Rodgers. The coach said he wanted to meet with the veteran before choosing a direction at quarterback.
A formal announcement is likely in the coming days.
Rodgers said at the end of the season that he understood the circumstances, that the Jets, with a new regime, might want to start fresh at quarterback.
"Either way, I won't be upset or offended whatever they decide to do," he said.
Rodgers accounted for 18 starts, six victories, one highly publicized Achilles tear and countless headlines in his two years with the Jets. It's unclear whether he will continue his career; he has maintained that he's undecided on a 21st season.
The future Hall of Famer has one year remaining on his contract, a nonguaranteed $37.5 million. He was due to count $23.5 million on the cap.
The Jets will be left with $49 million in dead money, which can be spread over two years if he's designated a post-June 1 cut. In that case, they would have to carry his $23.5 million on the cap until June 1. At that point, he'd count $14 million in 2025, a net savings of $9.5 million.
However, in the June 1 scenario, there would be a $35 million charge in 2026.
If he opts for retirement, the same accounting applies.
Determined to end their five-decade Super Bowl drought, the Jets made the biggest trade in franchise history on April 24, 2023, acquiring the four-time MVP from the Green Bay Packers for a package of draft picks.
Expectations soared, as the Jets trumpeted Rodgers as the missing piece. His first season ended soon after it began, with a torn left Achilles on the fourth snap of the 2023 season.
Rodgers returned healthy in 2024, started every game despite some nagging leg injuries and delivered a vintage, four-touchdown game in the season finale -- a 32-20 win over the Miami Dolphins. There weren't many games like that for Rodgers, whose performance over the course of the season was uneven.
He passed for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, both third on the Jets' single-season list, but he also had 11 interceptions and finished with a 48.1 QBR, which ranked 25th out of 32 qualified NFL passers. The Jets underachieved on offense, finishing 24th in scoring, and went 5-12, in one of the season's biggest disappointments.
Rodgers' slow start was a big reason coach Robert Saleh was fired only five games into the season. Rodgers' closest confidant, offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, was demoted at that point. Six weeks later, Joe Douglas was fired as the general manager.
Saleh, Douglas and Hackett were part of the Jets' contingent that visited Rodgers at his Malibu, California, home in March 2023, persuading the quarterback to play for the Jets. At that point, the Jets and Packers started working on a trade that took a month to finalize. By then, the Packers had decided to promote Jordan Love to the starting job.
So began five months of breathless hype for the Jets, highlighted by an appearance on HBO's "Hard Knocks." Rodgers debuted with the team Sept. 11, 2023, on "Monday Night Football." During introductions, he ran out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel carrying an American flag -- one of the greatest moments of his career, he later said.
Within minutes, he crumpled to the ground after a sack, his left Achilles ruptured.
Rodgers' expected departure will leave Tyrod Taylor, 35, as the only experienced quarterback on the roster. The Jets are likely to pursue a starting-caliber quarterback in the offseason. They also could draft a quarterback.
Rodgers' imminent departure also means they could release wide receiver Davante Adams, who will have to renegotiate his prohibitive cap charge ($38.3 million) to stay on the roster. Adams said after the season that his decision would be influenced by whether Rodgers stays or goes.

Content:
Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont acknowledged fans' frustration following the shocking decision to trade franchise superstar Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, while still defending the move and making clear there are no plans to relocate the team from Dallas.
Speaking for the first time publicly about the trade, Dumont told The Dallas Morning News that it has been an emotional week for the franchise, which has seen its own fans protest outside the arena.
"I clearly understand that, and I really appreciate that," Dumont said about the fans' reaction to the blockbuster deal. "I'm a big Luka fan. My family are big Luka fans. I have a really deep appreciation for what he brought to this team, what he brought to Dallas, and the excitement he brings. He's an electrifying player.
"I want you to know I really sympathize with all of our fans who feel hurt. Look, as far as I'm concerned, Luka is a Mav for life, and I really wish him nothing but happiness and success in his career as he continues in L.A."
The Mavericks received 10-time All-Star Anthony Davis back in the trade, an addition the franchise thinks will help it return to the NBA Finals. Dumont said that goal was top of mind when making the move. The Mavericks had struggled this season following their Finals appearance last summer, most notably since Doncic went down with a calf strain Dec. 25.
Doncic's recent injury history has been tied to conditioning concerns the Mavericks had with their star, according to reporting from ESPN's Tim MacMahon. Dumont reiterated statements made by general manager Nico Harrison that the team was focused on bringing in players who could help build and improve the Mavericks' "culture," but he stopped short of saying Doncic didn't fit that culture.
"In my mind, the way teams win is by focus, by having the right character, by having the right culture, and having the right dedication to work as hard as possible to create a championship-winning outcome," Dumont told the Morning News. "And if you're not doing that, you're going to lose."
Dumont also addressed rumors that the trade was the first step in an attempt to move the Mavericks from Dallas to Las Vegas, where much of his family's business is based.
"The Dallas Mavericks are not moving to Las Vegas," Dumont said. "There is no question in that. That is the answer, unequivocally. The Dallas Mavericks are the Dallas Mavericks, and they will be in Dallas."
Questions have also been raised about the Mavericks' willingness to pay for a supermax contract worth nearly $350 million, which Doncic would have been eligible to sign this summer. Dumont denied that the trade was related to cutting costs.
"This is not a resource consideration," he said. "For people who understand the NBA ... the salary cap is basically the cap. So this is just a risk-allocation decision, right? No problem signing someone to the supermax. It's just a portion of your cap. So it wasn't an issue. Happy to do it if it's there, no problem."

AUSTIN, Texas -- Madison Booker had 20 points and 11 rebounds and Rori Harmon hit two critical free throws in the final seconds as the Texas women's basketball team beat No. 2 South Carolina 66-62 on Sunday, ending the Gamecocks' 57-game Southeastern Conference regular-season winning streak dating back to 2021.
Harmon converted a pair of free throws with 10.8 seconds left to extend Texas' two-point lead to the final four-point margin.

MILWAUKEE -- Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid acknowledged Sunday that he might have to undergo another surgery on the left knee that has bothered him over the past year if it isn't feeling any better by the end of the season.
ESPN's Lisa Salters reported during the ABC telecast of the 76ers' 135-127 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks that he told her he believes repairing his knee "will likely take another surgery and a long recovery period, something he didn't have after the initial injury last February."
The 2022-23 MVP wasn't as definitive about it when talking to reporters after the game but indicated offseason surgery could at least be a possibility.
"I think the straightforward answer is that when you've got something that's inconsistent, at some point, you've got to do something about it," Embiid said. "We don't know what it is. We're looking into every option."
Embiid returned to action Tuesday after missing 15 games because of his knee problem. He has averaged 26.3 points, 10 rebounds and 7.3 assists in the three games he has played over the past week.
He played just 39 games last season because of a torn meniscus in his left knee. The 76ers announced in early February of that season that he had undergone surgery. Embiid came back in early April, was part of the 76ers' playoff run and then won a gold medal with the U.S. Olympic team last summer.
Embiid acknowledged after Sunday's game that he didn't have enough time after undergoing surgery last year.
"At some point I probably need to just, especially when the summer comes around, these few months to just recover fully," Embiid said. "Like I said, don't know what it is, but if that keeps being the same pattern, then obviously you've got to try something else."
Embiid, 30, has averaged 24.6 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists in 15 games this season.
"Every day, take it day by day," Embiid said. "If it gets worse, then you've got to do something about it. If it's not consistent enough, then that's not good enough."
